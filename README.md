Colorful Squares React Project
Welcome to the Colorful Squares React project! This simple React application allows users to interact with a grid of squares to change their colors upon hovering. Additionally, users can revert the squares back to their original white color by clicking the "Delete This" button.

How to Use
Hover over Squares: Move your cursor over any square in the grid to change its color to black.
Click "Delete This": Click the "Delete This" button to reset all squares back to their original white color.
That's it! Feel free to experiment with the squares and enjoy the colorful display.
